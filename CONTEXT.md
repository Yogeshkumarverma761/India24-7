# India247 - Development Context

This file serves as a persistent tracking document to record progress, bugs fixed, and future features for the **India247** civic platform.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a modern, responsive, premium frontend for India247 — a civic complaint platform designed for Indian citizens. It features an AI chat-based reporting interface and detailed real-time issue tracking.
**Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 + React Router + Leaflet.js

## ✅ Progress Log

### Phase 1: Setup & Design System
- Scaffolding the React + Vite application.
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 via `index.css`.
- Created custom theme tokens referencing the project's strict color palette (Saffron, India Green, Navy, and status colors).
- Configured `manifest.json` for PWA capabilities setup.

### Phase 2: Architecture & Global Components
- Engineered `mockData.js` simulating realistic active complaints, officer credentials, and ranking citizens in New Delhi.
- Built `Navbar.jsx` with responsive layouts and mobile hamburger integration.
- Developed structural UI elements: `ComplaintCard.jsx`, `StatusBadge.jsx`, and `ChatBubble.jsx`.

### Phase 3: Core Page Development
- **`LandingPage.jsx`**: Built stacked impact header ("Report. Track. Resolve."), dynamic `CountUp` number animations triggered on viewport scroll, category navigation, and simulated chat interface visualization.
- **`ReportPage.jsx`**: Fully functioning interactive 6-step state machine simulating an AI dialog (issue selection, native system file picker integration, location tagging).
- **`MapPage.jsx`**: Rendered an interactive `react-leaflet` map with custom colored coordinate markers representing priority escalations around Delhi.
- **`FeedPage.jsx`**: Implemented main issue feed, trending tags sidebar, and top citizen leaderboard.
- **`TrackerPage.jsx`**: Interactive ticket tracing timeline presenting L1/L2 escalation tiers and visual officer rating overlays.
- **`RewardsPage.jsx`**: Citizen dashboard tracking impact points, tiered unlocking badges, and reward redemption simulated grids.
- **`OfficerDashboard.jsx`**: Auth-gated dashboard (mocked login) presenting quick-metrics, issue response toggles, and escalation alert panels.

### Phase 4: Key Fixes & Refinements
- Fixed the Map rendering collapsed grey boxes by defining explicit `65vh` height and ensuring global `leaflet.css` module availability.
- Fixed a silent failure blank page inside `OfficerDashboard` (caused by a missing icon import).
- Upgraded the `ReportPage` photo upload to correctly map virtual clicks into the native DOM file explorer.
- Redesigned the Hero section header to dramatically stack individual keywords per line for visceral impact.

### Phase 5: Feature Additions
- Added a floating glassmorphism AI Assistant widget (Meera) to the Landing Page with custom hover tooltips, animated floating states, and an initial greeting conversation element.

### Phase 6: API Integration
- Switched from Claude API to Gemini API (free tier)
- Model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17
- Gemini API key in GEMINI_API_KEY constant
- Full AI conversation flow, image verification, and complaint summary all working

## 🚀 Next Steps & Future Capabilities
- Add global state management (Zustand/Context API) whenever mock data transforms to dynamic data.
- Stub out actual Language Translation implementation (Hindi).
- Deepen accessibility compliance (WCAG ARIA tags).
